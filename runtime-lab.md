# Runtime Selection for Real-Time Chat Application

**Chosen Runtime:** Node.js

**Why Node.js:**  

I would choose Node.js for a real-time chat application because it’s fast, efficient, and handles multiple users at the same time without slowing down. Its event-driven, non-blocking architecture makes sending and receiving messages in real time smooth and reliable. Node.js also has a lot of ready-to-use tools and libraries like Socket.IO, which makes building real-time features easier and faster.  

Other options like Python or Go can also work, but Node.js has the best balance of performance, scalability, and ease of development for chat applications. It’s widely used, well-supported, and great for building apps that need instant communication.

**Conclusion:** Node.js is the best choice for real-time chat because it’s fast, scalable, and developer-friendly.
